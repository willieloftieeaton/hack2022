	We are given data of people who have and have not started using an app, 
	and how their behaviour has/has not changed. We need to predict the 
	behaviour of new people who have/have not started using the app. 
	Behaviour Type Descriptions

								  JUDGE
============================================================================
The folling 5 criteria are weighted equally:
CONCEPT
	- Did we have a good solution?
	- Did we understand and research the problem?
	- Did we understand the end user's needs?
CREATIVITY
	- How creative were we?
	- Did we come up with a radical approach, or follow existing solutions?
	- Is this a differentiated idea in some way?
SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
	- Did we combine provided data with other data?
	- Did we create value there?
DATA SCIENCE/MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATION
	- Did we come up with a model that provides insights to the business?
	- This model needs to be data driven, but is not limited to pure
	  machine learning applications (Model can also describe a system or a 
	  process).
BUSINESS MODEL/IMPACT
	- Is the idea feasible, does it have economic and societal value, and 
	  is it sustainable?
	- If a small business used their data in this way, would it unlock new 
	  value and improve the business?
